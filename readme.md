- Pokémon Information Tool (PokeAPI): Search for detailed information about your favorite Pokémon, including their abilities, types, and more.

- Book Details Tool (Google Books API):Search for books by title and get information like book summaries, author details, and where to find them.

- Cryptocurrency Data Tool (NekkoCoin API): Track real-time prices for various cryptocurrencies.

## TODO
